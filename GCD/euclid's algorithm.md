Gcd:

A>B (assumption)
If B==0 return A;
Else return (B, B%A);

And vice versa

GCD(A,B) = GCD(B, A%B)   [SINCE GCD (A,B) = GCD(B, A-B), = GCD(B, A-2B)]

It is a%2==0 && b%2 ==0;
Mudulo are expensive operations, this would rather be cheaper.
Left shift(<<) is equivalent of *2
Right shift (>>) is equivalent of /2
